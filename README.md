This is the repo for my personal website. It includes the code for the site itself (a Hugo site), the Hugo theme, and all of the post content.

The theme is a soft-fork of the [Terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) by Panr. My fork is in the /themes/terminal-custom/ directory. My fork is licensed under the MIT license, like the original.

Each post specifies it's own license. Generally speaking, the content of the post is shared under a license that requires attribution, but the code examples can be used commercially without attribution.

If you would like to deploy this site, clone the repo and run "hugo server".

Feel free correct typos and other issues via PR.
