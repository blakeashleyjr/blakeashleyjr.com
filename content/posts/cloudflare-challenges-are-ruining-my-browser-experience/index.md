I travel often. Sometimes I use a VPN, sometimes I don't. I use a heavily customized Firefox config on Linux.

Cloudflare challenges have made large portions of the web unusable for me.

Some recent examples

- The "unsubscribe" button in Indeed's job notification emails leads me to an impassable Cloudflare challenge. The "Contact Us" page is also behind an impassable Cloudflare challenge. 
- While migrating a non-profit off of A2 Hosting, their login forces me to re-enter credentials after failing a challenge, looping endlessly. 
- On a particularly ironic note, I tried to complain on the Cloudflare Forumsâ€”met with another impassable challenge.

When reachable, customer support always says "try a mobile data connection", "switch to Chrome", or some other variant of "too bad, so sad".

Is anyone else dealing with this mess?

Note: This site is regertablly hosted by Cloudflare Pages, but I have it on my list to move to a self-hosted solution soon.
