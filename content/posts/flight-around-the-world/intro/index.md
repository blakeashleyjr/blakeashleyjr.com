I became a private pilot in high school but haven't flown much since due to life commitments and the expense of flying.

Even with an improved financial situation, the high cost of real-world flying (over $150 an hour with an instructor) led me to seek more affordable alternatives.

I am currently a private pilot, a technical term for a pilot who can fly when he or she can see (visual flight rules). The next rating I'm pursuing is called the instrument rating. It allows a pilot to fly into low-visibility and cloudy conditions (instrument flight rules). It is essential for anything beyond recreational flying in clear skies.

Weather can change rapidly, leaving pilots stranded or worse. Flying in clouds can be deadly without proper training and preparation.

Instead of spending $10K+ on real-world training, I invested in a high-quality Microsoft Flight Simulator setup. After brushing up my skills by practicing locally, I decided to take on a global challenge: flying around the world.

Flying around the world is a tradition as old as aviation itself, and many adventurers still undertake this journey today in real life and in the sim.

## Ground Rules and Objectives

To make this adventure as realistic as possible, I set the following rules:

    - Realistic IFR route with live weather.
    - No cheats like midair refueling or active pause.
    - Treat the airplane and decision-making as I would in real life (real go-arounds, weather avoidance, etc).
    - Prepare as if it were a real flight, including checking weather and NOTAMs (notice to airmen).
    - Fly on the VATSIM network to simulate real-life interactions with air traffic controllers and other pilots.
    - Enable failures via the RandFailures mod for more realistic challenges.
    - Preferably complete flight legs in one sitting, though this is flexible.

## Choosing My Virtual Aircraft and Route

I learned to fly in a Cessna 172 (see the cover photo for the Cessna I learned in), a reliable and popular plane. However, for this journey, I needed something faster and more advanced.

Enter the Beechcraft Baron G58. This aircraft is an excellent balance of speed, comfort, and technology, while also being an airplane that I could possibly fly in real life.

The Baron can:

    - Cruise at over 200 knots.
    - Fly above 20,000 feet.
    - Cover 1,400+ nautical miles on a single fuel stop.
    - Features advanced technology like a Garmin G1000 avionics suite and onboard weather radar.

For my route, I'll take off and land at my home airport, San Diego (KSAN). While I love flying into small airports, this adventure is about gaining experience with busy, complicated ones.

The itinerary: Start in San Diego, go up the West Coast to San Francisco and Portland, and then onto Anchorage. From there, it's off to Japan, Southeast Asia, India, Dubai, and eventually Europe. The final leg involves crossing the Atlantic via Iceland, Greenland, and Newfoundland, before returning to San Diego across the Lower 48.

## In Conclusion

I plan on documenting this virtual globe-trotting adventure on my blog. It may take a while, but it promises to be an exciting journey. Feel free to follow along or share your own flight simulation stories in the comments!
