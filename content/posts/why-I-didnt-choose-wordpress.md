# 

Wordpress is great, mostly.

Pros:

- Awesome breadth of functionality
- Plugin for everything
- Easy to use
- Tons of hosts, support, devs, etc. available
- Allows normal people to use their site day to day

Cons:

- Pretty easy to break
- Difficult to track content in version manager
- Heavily commericialized
- Requires a DB

Why I chose Hugo instead.
