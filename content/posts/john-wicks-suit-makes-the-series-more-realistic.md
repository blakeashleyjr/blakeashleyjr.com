John Wick 4 is bigger, better, badder than any other fighting-focused action movie, ever. It even improves on the earlier installments with its creativity, scale, and precision. Of course, I am only talking about the fighting. The rest of the movie is basically unimportant to me, as it was in the others, as well.

- Intro to John Wick
- Bullet proof suits
  - At first I thought they brought the realism and belivability of the movie down
  - They are not as sci-fi as you think
  - Once you accept the slight unrealism of the suits, the fighting becomes way more believable
- Classic action movie problem
  - Unless the hero is armored head-to-toe or superhuman, between one and a few bullets will likely kill.
  - So the movie is not believable, because I know the hero will not die.
  - So the writers find creative ways for the hero to win shootouts and luckily dodge the enemy's bullets.
  - They may kill a side-kick to prove the mortality of the parties involved, but the hero is not really vulernable.
- Turn shootouts into martial arts contests
  - Instead of shooting fake bullets at each other, the people in the John Wick movies (and their audience) accept that the bullets are not likely to do damage at range.
  - With that option removed, they are forced to get in close, and it becomes a contest to see who can manuver a bullet into the enemies head in hand-to-hand combat.
  - This is movie-making genius, because it allows for such a wide-range of fights that would be otherwise impossible. Without these suits, the parties would just back up, create distance, and shoot it out (like the usually do in real-life.)
  - Instead, the martial arts ability of John Wick and Keanu Reaves are on full display.
  - Once that minor sci-fi hurdle is jumped, the whole movie becomes more believable and a lot more fun.
