I am migrating off of Todoist after 8 years and over 12,000 tasks completed. Todoist has been the core of my organization and productivity since I created my account on the service. It got me through college and my professional life so far. Overall, I enjoyed the service and happily paid for the business account.

All was well until a few weeks ago. I changed my email as I continually de-google my life. Todoist being one of my most important accounts, I changed the account email. Logged out. Bitwarden auto-filled the new details for me. Locked out. "Incorrect email or password" for both the old email and the new one.

Luckily, it started working a few minutes later, but I couldn't shake that memory of my heart skipping a few beats when that error message popped up. How bad would it be if I was locked out of my Todoist account? Or worse, Todoist deleted my account? I realized I was completely dependent on this service. Not only were all my tasks for the last 8 years stored here. Priceless information about projects, plans, hopes, and dreams were stored in the comments, attachments, and descriptions of the tasks. I used Todoist to take quick notes, bookmark sites, and even as a makeshift CRM to keep in touch with friends and family. Needless to say, losing the account would be painful.

Beyond the pain of losing the account, this exercise got me thinking about how much I actually had in that account and the privacy concerns related to it. Sure, a hacker, rogue employee, or future acquirer[^1] wouldn't be able to drain my bank account with access to my Todoist account, but they would have access to the inside of my thoughts, plans, and dreams going back almost a decade. The thought of so many people[^2], even without a malicious actor, makes me uncomfortable.
