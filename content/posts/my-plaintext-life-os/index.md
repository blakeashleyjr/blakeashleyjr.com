In the excellent book, *The Righteous Mind*, author Jonathan Haidt details a metaphor for the relationship between our concious and unconcious minds: the elephant and the rider. The foolish rider thinks he is in control of the towering beast because it generally follows his commands, slowly lumbering from side to side at the pull of the reins. Little does the rider know, the elephant could throw rider to his death in a moment. If the rider pushs too hard, demands too much, he may lose what he thought was the unconditional obedience of the elephant. Instead, the rider must form a mutually beneficial relationship with the elephant, just as our concious mind must be gentle and loving with our subconcious mind (if we want to get anything valuable out of it.)

When I was younger, I thought of my subconcious as a simple computer. A computer obeys me when I tell it to do something, immediately dedicating everything it has to my command. My subconcious was not so compliant.

And so, I would begin years of productivity cycles. At first, my rider would excite the elephant, driving him faster and faster. The results were good. My elephant would soon tire and the fun would be over. 

My brain is not a computer, but it does share some characteristics with a computer.

An [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) is low-level software that manages hardware and software resources while scheduling tasks for efficent use of those resources.

My "hardware" is my affectionate name for my low-level needs and desires, both physical and emotional.
